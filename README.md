**Python-to-Ruby porting assistant**

"Translator" is too strong a word.  But this script is intended to
make porting code from Python to Ruby a bit easier by doing some of
the grunt work that can be easily done
programmatically&mdash;rewriting control expressions, adding `end`
keywords at the end of blocks, that sort of thing.
